Container as non-root user and random user id
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Containers should not run as root. Within OpenShift they run by default
under a random user id. Fortunately Jira already runs as a non-root user
Jira. Unfortunately the Jira application expects to run as the user
Jira. That is where our
https://github.com/RHsyseng/container-rhel-examples/tree/master/starter-nsswrapper[starter-nsswrapper]
project comes in. The starter-nsswrapper project contains an example
Dockerfile and scripts when dealing with an application that requires a
defined user. In every situtation modification most likely be required.

Modification to starter-nsswrapper

1.  Additional files need to be copied into the image
2.  user_setup script

* Changed useradd to usermod - Jira installer creates user, all we have
to do is modify it. *NOTE:* For the sed command in the
link:../Dockerfile[Dockerfile] to work correctly the gid of the user
must be set to 0.
* Added $\{APP_HOME} to chown and chmod commands

1.  Changed CMD from run to the script that starts Jira
